- 👋 Hi, I’m @pauliulianpasca
- 👀 I’m interested in Junior Software QA testing opportunities 
- 🌱 I’m currently interested to learn automation testing with Selenium and Pyhton 
- 📫 How to reach me pauliulianpasca@gmail.com

  After finishing a QA course with my mentor, I learned about agile, manual testing, API testing (using Postman), writing bug reports and test cases, and automation testing (using Cypress). I'm always keen to learn and improve myself, and I see myself curious about learning new things
