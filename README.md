- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pauliulianpasca
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Junior Software QA testing opportunities 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested to learn automation testing with Selenium and Pyhton 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me pauliulianpasca@gmail.com

  After finishing a QA course with my mentor, I learned about agile, manual testing, API testing (using Postman), writing bug reports and test cases, and automation testing (using Cypress and Selenium). I'm always keen to learn and improve myself, and I see myself curious about learning new things
